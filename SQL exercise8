#Write a query identifying the *type* of each record in the **TRIANGLES** table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

- **Equilateral**: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
- **Isosceles**: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
- **Scalene**: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
- **Not A Triangle**: The given values of *A*, *B*, and *C* don't form a triangle.

    when A  =  B  and B = C  and A = C then 'Equilateral'
    when ((A=B) or (A=C) or (C=B)) and A+B > C then 'Isosceles'
    when A != B and B != C and C != A and A+B > C then 'Scalene'
